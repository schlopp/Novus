class DatabaseConnection(object):
    """
    A helper class to wrap around an :class:`asyncpg.Connection` object. This class is
    written so you don't need to interface with asyncpg directly (though you can if you
    want by using the :attr:`conn` attribute).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # The database can be used via context
    >>> async with DatabaseConnection() as db:
    >>>     values = await db("SELECT user_id FROM user_settings WHERE enabled=$1", True)
    >>> for row in values:
    >>>     print(row['user_id'])
    >>>
    >>> # Or you can get a connection object that you can pass around
    >>> db = await DatabaseConnection.get_connection()
    >>> await db("DELETE FROM user_settings")
    >>> await db.disconnect()
    >>>
    >>> # And transactions are also available
    >>> async with DatabaseConnection() as db:
    >>>     await db.start_transaction()
    >>>     await db("DELETE FROM guild_settings")
    >>>     await db.commit_transaction()

    Attributes
    -----------
    conn: :class:`asyncpg.Connection`
        The asyncpg connection object that we use internally.
    enabled: :class:`bool`
        Whether the database system is enabled or not.
